# Redis on Windows with MinGW64

This repository contains the Redis Windows portability layer and its first-class
MSYS2/MinGW64 build and test path. The supported development shell is the
MSYS2 `MINGW64` environment.

## Prerequisites

Install MSYS2 MinGW64 tools, a MinGW64 Tcl interpreter, Git, and the normal
Redis build dependencies. When invoking the wrappers from WSL or another host
shell, select MSYS2 with one of these mechanisms:

```bash
export MSYS_BASH=/path/to/msys2/usr/bin/bash.exe
./build-mingw.sh -j2
```

or:

```bash
./build-mingw.sh --msys-bash /path/to/msys2/usr/bin/bash.exe -j2
```

For repeated local use, put the same `MSYS_BASH=...` assignment in the ignored
`.local/mingw.env` file. The wrappers do not source arbitrary local scripts.
When they are already running inside an MSYS2 `MINGW64` shell, no path is
needed.

## Build and test

```bash
./build-mingw.sh -j2
./runtest-mingw.sh --clients 1 --quiet --timeout 600
./runtest-mingw.sh --cluster
./runtest-mingw.sh --sentinel
./runtest-mingw.sh --moduleapi --clients 1 --quiet --timeout 300
./runtest-mingw-service.sh
```

The service test needs an elevated Windows token. Use private test ports and
do not stop or reconfigure unrelated Redis services.

## Windows port boundaries

The Windows path uses IOCP networking, the Win32 file-descriptor layer, and the
QFork persistence implementation. Client I/O remains single-threaded until a
separate Windows qualification proves otherwise. Core-only package builds keep
bundled Redis modules outside the release boundary.

## CI and releases

The public-safe validation workflow checks tracked-content hygiene and runs a
MinGW build plus focused Windows tests. It does not publish artifacts, create
tags, or push changes. Public packages and release tags are created only by a
later, explicitly enabled CI release workflow after the full Windows
qualification matrix passes.

## Troubleshooting

- `MSYS2 bash is not configured`: set `MSYS_BASH`, pass `--msys-bash PATH`, or
  create `.local/mingw.env`.
- `MinGW Tcl not found`: install the MinGW64 Tcl package and run the wrapper
  from an MSYS2 `MINGW64` shell.
- stale allocator or dependency state after switching branches: run
  `./build-mingw.sh distclean` before rebuilding.
